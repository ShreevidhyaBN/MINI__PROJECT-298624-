TEST_PLAN of TIC-TAC-TOE

##TEST PLAN


•	The function written to display 3x3 grid has to be tested and also make sure it is displayed in desired format.

•	Secondly marking the grid that is placing X and O within a gird should be tested. As it will be a 3x3 grid, the marking has to be done between 1-9 places of the grid. 
If the player exceeds this range (Ex: 10 or 11) a pop up of “invalid move” should be displayed.

•	Lastly displaying the winner of the game by checking all the possibilities and also to display a tie if no player could mark vertical/horizontal/diagonal with
his/her respective character (X or O).
